	abstract = {Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq is one of the most commonly performed bioinformatics analyses. Transcript-level quantifications are inherently more uncertain than gene-level read counts because of ambiguous assignment of sequence reads to transcripts. While sequence reads can usually be assigned unambiguously to a gene, reads are very often compatible with multiple transcripts for that gene, particularly for genes with many isoforms. Software tools designed for gene-level differential expression do not perform optimally on transcript counts because the read-to-transcript ambiguity (RTA) disrupts the mean-variance relationship normally observed for gene level RNA-seq data and interferes with the efficiency of the empirical Bayes dispersion estimation procedures. The pseudoaligners kallisto and Salmon provide bootstrap samples from which quantification uncertainty can be assessed. We show that the overdispersion arising from RTA can be elegantly estimated by fitting a quasi-Poisson model to the bootstrap counts for each transcript. The technical overdispersion arising from RTA can then be divided out of the transcript counts, leading to scaled counts that can be input for analysis by established gene-level software tools with full statistical efficiency. Comprehensive simulations and test data show that an edgeR analysis of the scaled counts is more powerful and efficient than previous differential transcript expression pipelines while providing correct control of the false discovery rate. Simulations explore a wide range of scenarios including the effects of paired vs single-end reads, different read lengths and different numbers of replicates.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq (dscRNA-seq) data are being generated at an unprecedented pace, and the accurate estimation of gene-level abundances for each cell is a crucial ﬁrst step in most dscRNA-seq analyses. When pre-processing the raw dscRNA-seq data to generate a count matrix, care must be taken to account for the potentially large number of multi-mapping locations per read. The sparsity of dscRNA-seq data, and the strong 3’ sampling bias, makes it difﬁcult to disambiguate cases where there is no uniquely mapping read to any of the candidate target genes.},

	abstract = {We introduce alevin, a fast end-to-end pipeline to process droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing data, performing cell barcode detection, read mapping, unique molecular identifier (UMI) deduplication, gene count estimation, and cell barcode whitelisting. Alevin’s approach to UMI deduplication considers transcript-level constraints on the molecules from which UMIs may have arisen and accounts for both gene-unique reads and reads that multimap between genes. This addresses the inherent bias in existing tools which discard gene-ambiguous reads and improves the accuracy of gene abundance estimates. Alevin is considerably faster, typically eight times, than existing gene quantification approaches, while also using less memory.},
